<p>Thunderbird is a modern email client with features such as intelligent spam filters, a built-in spell checker, a range of themes and customiseable layout. Thunderbird provides IMAP/POP support, support for HTML mail, quick search, addressbook, advanced message filtering, address completion, import tools, and the ability to manage multiple e-mail and newsgroup accounts. With Thunderbird Extensions you can add additional features to help you build a mail client that meets your specific needs.</p>
<p>As with Firefox, security is a central theme. Thunderbird provides enterprise and government grade security features such as S/MIME, digital signing, message encryption, support for certificates and security devices. The intelligent Thunderbird spam filter analyzes your e-mails to identify those that are most likely to be junk. You can automatically have your junk mail deleted or you can put it in a separate folder so you can check it before deleting. The spam filter also learns from your address book and usage to improve its accuracy.</p>
