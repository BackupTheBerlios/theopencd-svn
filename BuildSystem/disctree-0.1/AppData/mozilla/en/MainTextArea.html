<p>Mozilla is a full featured Browser, Mail and News Suite. It includes advanced options such as pop-up ad blocking, tabbed browsing, and an email spam-filter. The simple web page designer lets you create and publish your own web pages. With the majority of viruses currently being written specifically to exploit the default Windows browser and email client (Internet Explorer and Outlook Express), one of the simplest steps you can take to reduce your exposure to viruses is to switch to an alternate set of applications, such as Mozilla. We include a small selection of useful Mozilla plug-ins on the CD, but there are many more available on the net. After installing Mozilla and setting it as your default browser (at least for the moment), you can install plug-ins by clicking on the button on the right.</p>
