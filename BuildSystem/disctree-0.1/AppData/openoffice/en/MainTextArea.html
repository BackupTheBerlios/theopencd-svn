<p>OpenOffice.org is a full featured productivity suite, including a word processor, spreadsheet, web page editor and presentation program, in tightly integrated modules. Notable features in this version are native PDF and Flash export at a click and a macro recorder for increased productivity. You can create mail merged documents from your Outlook or Mozilla address book, or other data sources. Documents are saved in open standard XML files (compressed), which ensures future availability of the data and decreases the required storage space. For convenience, the program also reads and writes files in a wide range of formats, including MS-Office.</p>
<p>The suite is available in a growing number of languages (xx+; though the version on this CD is English), and the Dictionary Installer helps you download and install spelling dictionaries for a range of languages. (A US English version is installed by default. -- Make sure OpenOffice.org is installed before running the dictionary utility.) OpenOffice.org is Also available on Linux, Unix, and MacOSX.</p>
<p>Due to the high cost of commercial office suites, deciding to use OpenOffice.org will typically represent the single largest source of savings on software for organizations or individuals. We have included a Flash demo which lets you preview OpenOffice.org before installing.</p>
