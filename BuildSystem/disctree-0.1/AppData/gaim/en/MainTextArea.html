<p>Gaim is an instant messenger client that works with all major protocols in a single application. Instant Messaging (IM) is a quick way to exchange short messages with others over the internet. Once registered with a protocol host such as ICQ or Yahoo, you can communicate with other members. Gaim users can log in to multiple accounts on multiple IM networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on AOL Instant Messenger, talking to a friend on Yahoo Messenger, and sitting in an IRC channel all at the same time. Available protocols: IM (Oscar and TOC protocols), ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo!, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks.</p>
<p>Gaim supports many features of these networks, such as file transfer (coming soon), away messages, typing notification, and MSN window closing notification. It also goes beyond that and provides many unique features. A few popular features are <i>Buddy Pounces</i>, which give the ability to notify you, send a message, play a sound, or run a program when a specific buddy goes away, signs online, or returns from idle.</p>
<p>The compact design leaves plenty of screen space for you to work on other things while messaging. Gaim integrates into the Windows system tray, so you can work with Gaim without requiring the buddy list window to be up at all times. There is no spyware, advertising or other intrusive messages. The basic program can be expanded with a selection of plug-ins or consisting of text replacement, a buddy ticker, extended message notification, iconify on away, and more. You can also customise the look of Gaim with different sets of icons. Also available for Linux, BSD and MacOS X.</p>
